Our research focuses on boosting the functional persistence of T cells to develop innovative adoptive cell therapies. By diving deep into the biology of functional, exhausted, and engineered CD8+ T cells, we uncover critical metabolic, genetic, and epigenetic switches that control their fate. Harnessing these master regulators, we re-engineer T cells and explore how they adapt and respond to different signals and environments, paving the way for more powerful and durable immunotherapies.
