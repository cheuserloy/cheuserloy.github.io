Organelles are the internal batteries, gears, actuators, 3D printers and transmitters that drive cell function. Their composition and activity vary between cell types depending on functional demands. In T cells, which are key mediators of immunosurveillance and tumour eradication, organelles are relatively few and function at basal levels when cells are at rest. However, upon activation, they increase in number and size and undergo extensive remodelling to support rapid proliferation, effector differentiation and adaptation to diverse microenvironments, including the tumour microenvironment, thereby enabling efficient clearance of target cells. In this Review, we provide an overview of recent advances in our understanding of how various organelles contribute to T cell-mediated antitumour immunity. We also discuss emerging strategies to modulate organelle functions — from organelle-targeted therapies and their use as cargo delivery systems to the transfer or transplantation of native or synthetic organelles — that have the potential to enhance cancer immunotherapies involving immune-checkpoint blockade or the adoptive transfer of T cells.
