High frequencies of stem-like memory T cells in infusion products correlate with superior patient outcomes across multiple T cell therapy trials. Herein, we analyzed a published CRISPR activation screening to identify transcriptional regulators that could be harnessed to augment stem-like behavior in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Using IFN-Î³ production as a proxy for CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell terminal differentiation, LMO4 emerged among the top hits inhibiting the development of effectors cells. Consistently, we found that Lmo4 was downregulated upon CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activation but maintained under culture conditions facilitating the formation of stem-like T cells. By employing a synthetic biology approach to ectopically express LMO4 in antitumor CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, we enabled selective expansion and enhanced persistence of transduced cells, while limiting their terminal differentiation and senescence. LMO4 overexpression promoted transcriptional programs regulating stemness, increasing the numbers of stem-like CD8<sup>+</sup> memory T cells and enhancing their polyfunctionality and recall capacity. When tested in syngeneic and xenograft tumor models, LMO4 overexpression boosted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell antitumor immunity, resulting in enhanced tumor regression. Rather than directly modulating gene transcription, LMO4 bound to JAK1 and potentiated STAT3 signaling in response to IL-21, inducing the expression of target genes (*Tcf7*, *Socs3*, *Junb*, and *Zfp36*) crucial for memory responses. CRISPR/Cas9-deletion of *Stat3* nullified the enhanced memory signature conferred by LMO4, thereby abrogating the therapeutic benefit of LMO4 overexpression. These results establish *LMO4* overexpression as an effective strategy to boost CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell stemness, providing a new synthetic biology tool to bolster the efficacy of T cell-based immunotherapies.
