This unit describes a simple way to induce pyelonephritis in female mice using uropathogenic *Escherichia coli* (UPEC). Methods for culturing and preparing working stocks of UPEC are provided. Protocols to measure the bacterial load in the murine kidney following the establishment of pyelonephritis by determining the bacterial colony forming units (CFU) are also included. This assay can be performed with kidney homogenates if the bacterial load is the sole read-out or if cellular intactness is not required for subsequent assays, or from kidney single cell suspensions prepared by enzymatic digestion. A support protocol describes methods for isolating cells for flow cytometry, ex vivo culture, and other assays.
