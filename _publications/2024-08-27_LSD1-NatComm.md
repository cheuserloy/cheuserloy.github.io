The lysine-specific histone demethylase 1 A (LSD1) is involved in antitumor immunity; however, its role in shaping CD8 + T cell (CTL) differentiation and function remains largely unexplored. Here, we show that pharmacological inhibition of LSD1 (LSD1i) in CTL in the context of adoptive T cell therapy (ACT) elicits phenotypic and functional alterations, resulting in a robust antitumor immunity in preclinical models in female mice. In addition, the combination of anti-PDL1 treatment with LSD1i-based ACT eradicates the tumor and leads to long-lasting tumor-free survival in a melanoma model, complementing the limited efficacy of the immune or epigenetic therapy alone. Collectively, these results demonstrate that LSD1 modulation improves antitumoral responses generated by ACT and anti-PDL1 therapy, providing the foundation for their clinical evaluation.
