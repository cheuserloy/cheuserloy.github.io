My colleagues Luca Gattinoni and Jeremy Baldwin from the <a href="https://lit.eu/research/research-divisions/functional-immune-cell-modulation/">Leibniz Institute for Immunotherapy</a> and I dive into the fascinating world of organelles in T cell-based cancer immunotherapies: From breakthrough technologies to study organelle functions to innovative strategies that supercharge T cell function by targeting their organelles. Weâ€™re excited about the opportunity and editorial to support by Nature Reviews Immunology.
