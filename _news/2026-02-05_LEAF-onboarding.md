Biomedical labs contribute to global resource overuse not least by their notorious reliance on single-use plasticware. To make research more sustainable, the lab seeks certification under the LEAF program (Laboratory Efficiency Assessment Framework). The program helps identify opportunities to save energy, reduce waste, and improve recycling. Progress is evaluated regularly and recognized with bronze, silver, or gold certification.<br><br>
We will implement sustainability criteria into workflows, routines, and protocols from the get-go, helping to reduce consumption of consumables and reagents and to lower research operating costs.<br><br>
